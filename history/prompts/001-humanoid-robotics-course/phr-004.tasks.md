## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the implementation tasks for the Humanoid Robotics Course.
The tasks are detailed in the `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-course/tasks.md` file.

**Summary:**
- **Total task count**: 28
- **Task count per user story**: 5 tasks for each of the 4 user stories.
- **Parallel opportunities**: Content creation for chapters and modules can be parallelized.
- **Suggested MVP scope**: User Story 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The project now has a detailed, actionable task list for implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable for this stage.
- 📁 Files: Created `tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process was straightforward based on the detailed plan. The phased approach will make the implementation manageable.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
