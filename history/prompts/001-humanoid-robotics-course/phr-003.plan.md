## Prompt

/sp.plan Create a production-ready plan for building the AI/Spec-driven Docusaurus book.

Focus on:
1. Defining clear phases for writing, structuring, and deploying the book
2. Mapping modules → chapters → tasks
3. Identifying dependencies (Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code, Docusaurus setup)
4. Ensuring the plan supports RAG-friendly content generation later

Success criteria:
- Phases are actionable and sequenced
- Each phase lists concrete deliverables
- Includes workflow for writing, reviewing, and publishing the book

Constraints:
- Book platform: Docusaurus
- Output: A structured multi-phase plan (no code, no ADRs)

Not planning:
- RAG chatbot implementation (separate plan)
- Robotics technical content itself
- Deployment troubleshooting or CI/CD details

## Response snapshot

I have created a more detailed, production-ready implementation plan for the Humanoid Robotics Course.
The updated plan and design artifacts are located in the `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-course` directory.
The updated artifacts are:
- `plan.md`: A more detailed implementation plan including Phase 2 tasks.
- `data-model.md`: The data model with frontmatter specifications.
- `quickstart.md`: A more comprehensive quickstart guide.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The project now has a detailed, actionable plan for implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable for this stage.
- 📁 Files: Updated plan, data-model, and quickstart files.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The user's request for a more detailed plan was a good opportunity to flesh out the implementation details. This will make the next phase of defining tasks much easier.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
