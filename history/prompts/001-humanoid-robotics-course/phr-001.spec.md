## Prompt

Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Modules 1–4 Target audience: Students learning robotics, simulation, and AI-driven humanoid control Focus: Clear, modular explanations with 3–4 chapters per module Success criteria: - Each module explains core concepts with simple diagrams + minimal code - Content is RAG-friendly and consistent across modules - Reader gains practical understanding of humanoid robotics foundations Constraints: - 3–4 chapters per module - Format: Docusaurus sections via Spec-Kit Plus - No deep hardware specifics or advanced implementation details Not building: - Full robot deployments, SLAM pipelines, or full capstone execution - Vendor comparisons or hardware tuning Modules + Chapters: **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** 1. ROS 2 Overview 2. Nodes, Topics, Services 3. rclpy Agent Integration 4. URDF Basics for Humanoids **Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** 1. Intro to Digital Twins 2. Gazebo Physics & Environment 3. Unity Interaction & Rendering 4. Sensor Simulation (LiDAR/Depth/IMU) **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** 1. Isaac Sim Overview 2. Synthetic Data & Perception 3. Isaac ROS + VSLAM 4. Nav2 for Bipedal Path Planning **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** 1. LLMs for Robotics 2. Whisper Voice-to-Action 3. Cognitive Planning with LLMs 4. Mini Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification for the Humanoid Robotics Course.
The feature branch is `001-humanoid-robotics-course`.
The specification file is located at `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-course/spec.md`.
A checklist for the specification quality has been created at `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-course/checklists/requirements.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature is now clearly defined and ready for the planning phase.
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable for this stage.
- 📁 Files: Created spec and checklist files.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script was problematic and required debugging. The issue was with the `Join-Path` cmdlet in PowerShell. After fixing the script, the process was smooth.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script failed repeatedly due to incorrect usage of the `Join-Path` cmdlet.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
