## Prompt

/sp.plan Create a structured plan for producing the Docusaurus-based AI/Spec-driven book.

Focus:
- Phased workflow for writing, organizing, and publishing the book
- Mapping modules to chapters and tasks
- Dependencies: Docusaurus

Success criteria:
- Clear, sequential phases
- Actionable deliverables per phase
- Plan supports clean, consistent content generation

Constraints:
- Docusaurus only
- No RAG chatbot planning here

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan for the Humanoid Robotics Course.
The plan and other design artifacts are located in the `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-course` directory.
The generated artifacts are:
- `plan.md`: The implementation plan.
- `research.md`: Research on the hosting platform.
- `data-model.md`: The data model for the course content.
- `quickstart.md`: A quickstart guide for setting up the Docusaurus site.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The implementation plan is now ready, and the project can move to the task definition phase.
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable for this stage.
- 📁 Files: Created plan, research, data-model, and quickstart files.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The process was smooth. The `setup-plan.ps1` script worked as expected. I was able to generate all the required artifacts for the planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
