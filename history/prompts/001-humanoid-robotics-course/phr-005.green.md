## Prompt

/sp.implement implement in humanoid-robotics-course you have already this folder and update this

## Response snapshot

I have successfully implemented the Humanoid Robotics Course website.
All tasks from the `tasks.md` file have been completed.
The Docusaurus project has been created in the `website` directory, and the content for all modules has been added.
A GitHub Actions workflow has been set up to automatically deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Humanoid Robotics Course website is now fully implemented and ready for deployment.
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable for this stage.
- 📁 Files: Created Docusaurus project, content files, and deployment workflow.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The project is complete.
- 🧠 Reflection: The implementation process was smooth and followed the well-defined task list. The phased approach was effective in breaking down the work into manageable chunks.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
