# Mini Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

This chapter guides you through a mini-capstone project to build an autonomous humanoid robot that can understand and respond to voice commands.

The goal of this capstone project is to bring together all of the concepts that you have learned throughout this course to build a complete, end-to-end robotics application. You will build a simulated humanoid robot that can be controlled using natural language voice commands.

The project will be divided into several parts:
1.  **Robot Setup**: You will start by setting up a simulated humanoid robot in a Gazebo or Isaac Sim environment.
2.  **Voice Interface**: You will then create a voice interface for the robot using the Whisper speech recognition model.
3.  **Task Planning**: You will use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a sequence of actions for the robot based on the user's voice command.
4.  **Control System**: You will implement a control system that can take the output of the task planner and generate a stable walking trajectory for the robot.
5.  **Integration**: Finally, you will integrate all of these components together to create a complete, autonomous humanoid robot.

This project will give you hands-on experience in building a complex robotics application from scratch. It will also give you a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the field of humanoid robotics. By the end of this project, you will have a working simulation of a voice-controlled humanoid robot that you can use as a starting point for your own robotics projects.

### Evaluation

The evaluation of your capstone project will be based on several criteria, including:
- **Functionality**: Does the robot successfully understand and execute a range of voice commands?
- **Robustness**: How well does the robot handle unexpected situations and errors?
- **Elegance**: Is the code well-structured, easy to understand, and easy to maintain?
- **Creativity**: Have you added any creative or innovative features to the project?

You will be expected to submit a video of your project in action, as well as a short report that describes your design and implementation. You will also be expected to give a short presentation of your project to the class. This will give you an opportunity to showcase your work and to get feedback from your peers and instructors. The goal of this evaluation is not just to assess your technical skills, but also to encourage you to think critically about the design and implementation of complex robotics systems.
